# A few ideas on financial aid

## Introduction

Many conferences now run a financial aid program (also called scholarships or grants) to help people attend who might otherwise not be able to, because they can’t afford to. It may be harder for them to afford to attend due to not having an employer that will cover costs, low or no income, having financial dependents, high health care costs, or many other reasons.

The financial aid will typically cover anywhere between a free ticket, to a ticket with accommodation and travel costs. Sometimes not all applicants require their entire trip to be paid for. As there are typically more applicants than places, there is often some kind of selection process.

It’s incredibly valuable to help people, who might otherwise not be able to attend a conference, so it’s great that so many conferences do this. However, having looked at and asked questions about many of these programs, I developed some thoughts on improvements that could be made. I want to expand this into a wider guide to financial aid, but these are the most common issues I see.

These ideas are suggestions. They may not work for all conferences, and you may have good reasons to deviate. Not even my conferences follow all of this currently. Most importantly, this is not meant as _you are doing financial aid wrong and are bad people_, but only as _it’s great that you have a financial aid program, here are a few suggestions_. I assume everyone runs these programs with the best intentions, even if something is not ideal, and encourage you to approach these programs and organisers in that same spirit. I focus a lot on aid programs aimed at underrepresented groups, as these seem to be the most common.

## Asking for help is hard

The first thing to realise is that asking for help is hard for many people. And that means asking for financial aid can make people feel quite uncomfortable. In financial aid, it’s always easy to make up reasons why you shouldn’t apply. What if other people need it more, and have had less opportunity to go to conferences in the past? What if I’m not part of the target group and I’m defrauding the program by applying? What if I’m not experienced enough and someone else would take more out of it? What if I already had another grant in the past? Do I actually deserve to go?

Strange Loop does a great job by addressing such questions directly, by writing:

* *Already attended a conference in the past? That’s ok.*
* *Already received a grant in the past? Still ok.*
* *Don’t have much (or any) experience with the technology featured at Strange Loop? That’s ok, too.*
* *Don’t know anyone going? We have a guide program and organised meetups!*
* *Don’t want to take money away from someone else? Really, it’s ok, everyone says that!*
* *Don’t feel like you deserve this? That’s also ok: you do.*

With it being easy for people to feel discomfort and insecurity about applying, it’s important that we put extra effort into ensuring everyone feels welcome to apply.

## Be extremely explicit in who you are targeting

It is common for conferences to use their financial aid as a tool to improve diversity. Therefore, they often specify something like this:

> Anyone from an underrepresented group in tech is invited to apply for this scholarship. This includes, but is not limited to: women, people of colour, LGBTQIA+ people, disabled people, and people facing economic or social hardships.

Although this is done with the best intentions, here’s my issue with this text: could you tell me who the other underrepresented groups are that are invited? Are people with mental illnesses included, and classed under disabled? Are refugees included? People over 50? People who have never worked with the platform the conference focuses on before? People who are doing a career switch? People who have children that increase costs and make planning harder? People whose parents depend upon them? People who can work, but have high medical costs?

Knowing whether some aspect of you is underrepresented can be hard to determine, especially in aspects that are not easily visible. And there’s more: assuming people with mental illness are included under disabled, when do they qualify? Does it need to have a serious impact on your daily life? Do you need a formal diagnosis from a doctor? If you’re genderqueer, but do not currently present differently from your assigned gender, are you included in the LBGTQIA+? Who is included in that plus? What if you’re not even sure yourself about your identity?

For [Django: Under the Hood 2016](https://www.djangounderthehood.com), we tried to improve on this with the following text, inspired from [AlterConf](http://alterconf.com):

*Anyone from an underrepresented group in tech is invited to apply for this scholarship. This includes, but is not limited to*:
* *women and other gender minorities of all expressions and identities; e.g. trans, agender and non-binary*
* *people of color, including Indigenous/Native people*
* *sexuality minorities, including asexual people*
* *people with disabilities, both visible and invisible*
* *neurodiverse people*
* *people with chronic illnesses or diseases*
* *religious and ethnic minorities*
* *people who don’t speak English as a first language*
* *undocumented people (US), naturalized people, and refugees*
* *age minorities (under 21, over 50)*
* *working class people and people experiencing poverty*
* *homeless and home/food insecure people*
* *caregivers of children or other dependents*
* *people who have experienced trauma and its aftermath (PTSD, anxiety, etc)*
* *people living with or recovering from substance abuse*

This doesn’t address *all* these questions yet, and I really want to improve on this next year. But it is a lot more explicit than the shorter list. Note that we haven’t actually changed our target group: we already meant to include all these people. All of them were already welcome to apply. However, I seriously doubt any refugees, caregivers or neurodiverse people would have applied with our briefer text.

The more explicit you can be, the better. If someone is part of a group that you haven’t explicitly mentioned, as much as you intend to include them, you raise a much higher barrier for them to apply.

It’s fine to have a different target group, or to not limit on target group at all. Some conferences run aid programs exclusively for women (in that case I recommend being explicit on your stance on trans women and genderqueer people) or entirely different groups. Do make sure you are consistent: if you say in one place that your program is for women, and in another place have a more extensive list, there is a fair chance many non-women won’t feel welcome to apply.

Whichever target group you choose, be it anyone interested in attending or a much more specific group, be explicit, expansive, and consistent.

## Be mindful of excluding people with your requirements

Some aid programs include accommodation, and expect applicants to share their rooms with other applicants of the same gender. That makes complete sense from a cost perspective: with the same budget, you can provide aid to more people, and have a bigger impact on the community. 

However, it can also lead to unintentional exclusion of some people that are explicitly part of your target group. For example, some neurodiverse people are unable to share rooms, as they need their private space to withdraw into. If you require room sharing, these people can not participate. I’m also unsure how same-sex room sharing would work for genderqueer and non-binary people.

This doesn’t mean you can’t share any rooms: it’s perfectly fine to suggest it. However, be mindful in how you communicate: people should feel comfortable saying they need a private room, and this should be an option in your application form. If this is only possible after raising the issue by e-mail, for example, these applicants are more likely to just skip their application.

## Never ask people which underrepresented group they belong to

If your aid program is aimed at underrepresented groups, it may make sense to ask people which group they are part of. You might consider this in your screening proces to ensure everyone is part of your target group. In my opinion, this is incredibly harmful.

First of all, you usually can’t actually screen whether people are eligible this way. Typically the target group includes aspects that you can’t check, like invisible health issues or being LGBTQIA+. Therefore, anyone applying in bad faith could just lie.

More importantly, people might be very private about their exact situation, because this information coming out can have serious consequences for their life. Most people aren’t secretive about being a cis woman. But some people live in countries where they can be executed for their sexuality. Some depend financially on transphobic parents. In many countries, your health status can make it hard for you to keep or find work. People living with substance abuse could be fired. Some people might feel shame for their situation, such as people experiencing poverty.

In other words, if you are asking people which exact group they belong to, you are asking some of them to endanger their income, social situation, or even their life. At best, you are making them feel uncomfortable. And although this does not apply to everyone, these dangers are probably more common in people that are already underrepresented in multiple other ways.

## Be open about your selection process

Most aid programs get more applications than they can grant. So there needs to be some kind of selection process. When scoring applications for Django: Under the Hood in the past, the basic question for me was: _How can we maximise the impact on the applicants, their local community, our community in general and people in general, within the limited resources available to us?_

I liked to look at:

* To what extent will letting this person attend have a further impact on our community? For example, I’d score someone who essentially wrote “I will help my company make more money” lower than someone who is more active in their local community.
* Social impact can be a part too: I’d score “I use Django to help this bank I work for become richer” lower than “I work with Django as part of a project to help addicted homeless people towards recovery”.
* Where is this person from? If they would take a large budget, but live in an area that has many other conferences closer by, that may be a better choice. So all other things being equal, I would rather spend € 1000 on an attendee from Kenia than from New York.
* To what extent does this person have a skill level that lets them benefit from this conference? (In 2015, DUTH was aimed very much at developers with some Django experience already, so it would not be the best place for someone without any experience.)
* Are they making an effort? For example, if you can’t even estimate the price of your flight (we do suggest using Google Flights) without further explanation, I’m assuming you couldn’t be bothered to search.

However, those criteria were not published, so that made our selection process potentially less fair.

Another interesting approach is to assign tickets randomly, considering how easy it is to introduce unintended bias into your selection process. You can actually have this entire process run for you with [Diversity Tickets](https://diversitytickets.org)

Your conference might have other priorities. Perhaps students and teachers are important to you, and you’ll prioritise them over others. It’s also very common to prioritise accepted speakers over anyone else.
