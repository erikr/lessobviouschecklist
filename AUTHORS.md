This list is originally compiled by @erikr, based on experiences from attending many conferences, and co-organising Django Under the Hood in 2014 together the stellar @bmispelon, @olasitarska and @mjtamlyn, later expanded with ideas from the 2015 edition. 

Some conferences that inspired items on this list are [Django Circus](http://love.djangocircus.com) in Poland, [Django Island](http://2014.djangocon.eu) in France, [DjangoCon Europe 2015](http://2015.djangocon.eu) in Cardiff, [DjangoCon Europe 2016](http://2016.djangocon.eu), [PyCon UK 2016](http://2016.pyconuk.org/diversity-accessibility-inclusion/), and [mdevcon](http://mdevcon.com) in Amsterdam.

In other words, although I did compile this list, most of the recommendations would not exist without the hard work of many others.

Note that the conferences and people mentioned do not necessarily endorse this list.
